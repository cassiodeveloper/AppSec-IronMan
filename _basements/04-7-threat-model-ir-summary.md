#### Summary pt 1

- Your software version 1.0.1 must be better than 1.0.0.
  - Think like Tony Stak!
  - Not only **fix bugs**, you `must` **improve** security.
- There is no security, without proper SDL process and teams commitment.
- Imagine that each release of yours is a new Mark suit that Tony built.
  - Each suit is designed to protect his life, your software can't just `bring value` if the **value** does not **protect** your customer / user as well.
