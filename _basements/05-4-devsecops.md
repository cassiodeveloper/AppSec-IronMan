### [DevSecOps](devsecops.org)

- Culture
  - To make **everyone** within the SDL **participate**
- Process
  - To have a structured way of **how-to**
- Tools
  - Otherwise, you **won't** scale
- And my personal touch - **AUTOMATION**
  - Automation is the **key** to make your AppSec / DevSecOps whatever scale and work properly
