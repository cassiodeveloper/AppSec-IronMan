### Vulnerability Management

I think that at this point it's pretty clear that Tony manages his shit. Not by mistake every new suit, or Mark, has an improvement. Either to the defense power or attack power, sometimes even both.

How about your software? Do you have a `bug list`? How about a **vulnerability** list? And a security improvement list? `Security requirements` maybe?

Ok no worries...
