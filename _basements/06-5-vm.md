### Vulnerability Management tools

You can use any bug management system, task system etc that will work the same, the secret here is to centralize your vulnerabilities in one place.

But, one nice tool to use is [Defect Dojo](https://www.defectdojo.org/) from OWASP.

Or you can still use:

- Jira
- Excel
- Github Issues
- Notepad! (Just kidding, or not)
